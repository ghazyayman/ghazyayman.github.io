I'm Muhammad Ghazy, an apprentice security engineer. I learn <u>most</u> stuff by self-learning and try not to break things. I create and automate code based from open-source project, also giving back to the community. Now i'm more focused on <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/getting-started-with-web-application-penetration-testing/"><em>Web App</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/automation/network-automation.html"><em>Network Automation</em></a> stuff.

I keep my head straight up to my mission. Keep grinding because it’s all about <strong>timing</strong>, at the same time I’m open to every opportunity and learning new things. I recently learned about business and marketing and also read some books about how money works. You can read the summary <a href="https://ghazyayman.github.io/blog/">here</a>. Hit me up if you want to work together.

I remember a quote from Nietzche that said <i>"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."</i> Find your why, work towards your goals and purposes. At the end of the day, I'm just a man and his will to survive *insert Rocky theme

PS: Just look at my project eh? Ask me anytime.
