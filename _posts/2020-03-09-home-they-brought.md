title: Fanatical Prospecting - Chapter 1 Summary 
---
Fanatical prospecting is a sales approach that involves continuously seeking out and contacting new potential customers, often through multiple channels and methods, in order to generate leads and ultimately close more deals. The term "fanatical" refers to the intensity and persistence with which salespeople pursue these prospects, often with a focus on quantity rather than quality.

Fanatical prospecting may involve techniques such as cold calling, emailing, social media outreach, direct mail, and networking events, among others. The idea is to cast a wide net and be proactive in identifying and reaching out to potential customers, rather than waiting for them to come to you.

While fanatical prospecting can be effective in generating leads and closing deals, it is important to balance this approach with a focus on building relationships and providing value to customers. Too much focus on quantity over quality can lead to a reputation for being pushy or aggressive, which can ultimately harm a salesperson's success in the long run.

so let's get straight to the point.

What makes a superstar salesman?

A fanatical prospector : relentlessness, unstoppable prospecting.
With a pipeline full of qualified prospects.

Ability to prospect anywhere and anytime - constantly seeking the next opportunity.

Don’t care what people think of you.

Prospecting methods:
1. Telephone
2. Email
3. Cold calling
4. Networking
5. Referral
6. Knocking on doors
7. Following up on leads
8. Attend trade shows
9. Strike conversations with strangers.

What not to do if you want to succeed:
1. Don’t make excuses
2. Don’t complain
3. Don’t whine
4. Don’t live in fear
5. Don’t procrastinate

Prospect when times are good, when times are bad, and even when you don’t feel like it.

Carry around a pocket full of business cards.

Talk to everyone : strangers at the doctors office, sporting events, in line for coffee, in an elevator, at conferences, on planes, trains. Prospect EVERYWHERE.

Prospect morning, afternoon, and evening.

The enduring mantra: One more call.

Stop blaming others  - the product, the company, the technology.

Get moving, take action.

Hard work, determination, perseverance, and luck.

Failing in sales is not caused by:
1. A lack of talent
2. A lack of skill
3. A lack of training
4. Poor territory
5. An inferior product
6. Subpar communication
7. Poor presentation skills

Failure is caused by an empty pipe, caused by the failure to prospect.

“Lose weight effortless”
“With this revolutionary, breakthrough pill you’ll never have to worry about your weight again. Eat what you want. Forget about exercise. Just take this pill and you’ll have the body of your dreams.”

We’ve all seen these BS ads, we all know they are BS.

But companies wouldn’t spend money running them if they didn’t work - they do work.

“Easy is the greatest marketing hook of all time”

Stop falling for the marketing, work your damn ass off as a salesman.

Sales is not a nine-to-five job. There’s no days off, no vacations, no lunch breaks.

Skip the mean and do the deal. Whatever it takes to win.

There will always be obstacles, always rejection, always something to complain about.

Get over it and work hard.

Only three things you can control in life:
1. Your actions
2. Your reactions
3. Your mindset

Stop wishing things were easier, start wishing you were better!

Make the decision to do the hard work, pick up the phone, approach strangers, and get over yourself.

Choose to act, adopt a new mindset.

There’s no easy button.
