title:  The Millionaire Fastlane Summary 
---

The Millionaire Fastlane is a book written by MJ DeMarco that offers a roadmap for creating wealth quickly and escaping the traditional "slowlane" of traditional employment and retirement savings. The book argues that the traditional path of working a 9-to-5 job, saving for retirement, and relying on Social Security is too slow and too risky for most people. Instead, DeMarco suggests creating a business that can scale quickly, leveraging the power of the internet and other modern technologies to generate income and create wealth rapidly. The book emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship, financial education, and taking calculated risks in order to achieve financial freedom and live life on your own terms.

This is a summary for every chapter.

Chapter 1 :
1. “Get Rich Slow” demands a long life of gainful employment.
2. “Get Rich Slow” is a losing game because it is codependent on Wall Street an anchored by your time.
3. The real golden years of life are when you're young, sentient, and vibrant.

Chapter 2 :
1. Fame or physical talent is not a prerequisite to wealth.
2. Fast wealth is created exponentially, not linearly.
3. Change can happen in an instant.

Chapter 3 :
1. Wealth is a formula, not an ingredient.
2. Process makes millionaires. Events are by-products of process.
3. To seek a “wealth chauffeur” is to seek a surrogate for process. Process cannot be outsourced, because process dawns wisdom, personal growth, strength, and events.

Chapter 4 :
1. To force change, change must come from your beliefs, and your roadmap outlines those beliefs.
2. Each roadmap is governed by a wealth equation and predisposed to a financial destination-Sidewalk to poorness, Slowlane to mediocrity, and the Fastlane to wealth.

Chapter 5 :
1. A first-class ticket to the Sidewalk is to have no financial plan.
2. The Sidewalk's natural gravitational pull is poorness, both in time and money.
3. You cannot solve poor financial management with more money.
4. You can be income rich and still ride the Sidewalk dirty.
5. If wealth is defined by income and debt, wealth is an illusion, because it is vulnerable to potholes, detours, and “bumps in the road.” When the income disappears, so does the illusion of wealth.
6. Poor financial management is like gambling; the house eventually wins.
