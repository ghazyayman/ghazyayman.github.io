The easy way is to use Bundler to set up and run Jekyll locally. For this, you will need Ruby and Bundler installed for your platform.

After cloning the repo or downloading the source files, open a terminal inside the source folder and run:

    bundle install to install Jekyll and required plugins
    bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --trace
